What does it do?
================

Groupdelegation provides you the possibility to allow certain be-users to delegate certain be-groups to other be-users without having a TYPO3 admin account. This can be done using organisation units or not. That means e.g. you can determine that sub admin xx can only delegate groups to be-users of the organisation unit marketing.
The extension “groupdelegation” was developed by Sebastian Müller for “Technische Universität München”. The idea and most of the conceptional part were done by Bernhard Maier <maier@tum.de>.
Feature: sub admin backend groups are marked by another image so they are can be found fast among normal groups.
