Mind that how you become a sub admin is explained in the administration part.

After clicking on "Groupdelegation", you will see a list of users, which you can grant or withdraw permissions. For
every user you see the be-groups he/she belongs to. They are divided into those you are allowed to remove and those you
are not allowed remove.

Just click on the avatar or the button with the user name, when you want to edit it.

At the top of the following page, the user can be disabled and the start- and stoptime can be set.

Below is a list with all delegatable the groups. They can be added by activating the checkbox before.
Clicking the Save! button will add the selected groups to the user and remove the not selected ones.
