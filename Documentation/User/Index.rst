Using groupdelegation as Sub Admin
==================================

Mind that how you become a sub admin is explained in the administration part.

After clicking the User module groupdelegation you see a list of editable users. For every user you see the be-groups
he/she belongs to. They are divided into those you are allowed to remove and those you are not allowed remove.

Just click the name or the pen of the user you want to edit.

On the following page just select or deselect the groups you want. Clicking the Delegate! button will add the selected
groups to the user and remove the not selected ones.

Afterwards you will be redirected to the editable users overview page.
