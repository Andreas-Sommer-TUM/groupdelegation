# EXT:groupdelegation

The TYPO3 extension "goupdelegation" provides the possibility to allow certain be-users to delegate certain be-groups to
other be-users without having a TYPO3 admin account. This can be done using organisation units or not. That means e.g.
you can determine that sub admin xx can only delegate groups to be-users of the organisation unit marketing.

For a detailed manual have a look at the Documentation folder.
